# A1 Needfinding

## Hunch
"How does social media shape our in person plans and interactions?"

## Pre Interview Planning
For this assignment, I am going to be interviewing Jason and Caroline. Jason is a 26 year old accountant from New York. He regularly hangs out with friends in person, as well as used numerous different social media platforms. He has mentioned to me in passing about visiting places that he had seen on social media. As such, I think Jason makes a good canidate for learning how social media affects his in person meetings.

Caroline is a Neuroscience PHD student who just moved to Baltimore. Caroline has told me that she does not use social media as much as she used to. I also know that Caroline enjoys visiting trendy resteraunts and new art exhibits. It would be important information to know why Caroline uses social media less than she used to, as well as if she has used social media at all to find interesting places in her new city.

### Conversation Starters & Hunch Nudgers
- What was your first introduction to social media?
- Why did you start using social media?
- What social media do you currently/used to use?
- Do you feel like each social media had its own purpose / fulfilled a different need?
- What are your hobbies?
- Are there any intersections in your hobbies/interests and what you see on social media?
- Where do you like hanging out with friends?
- Are there any notable resteraunts/museums/other places of interest in your area?
- How did you find these places?
- Is there a qualitative difference between the places you visit after a social media reccomendation vs word of mouth?
- Do you interact with people on social media about your hobbies?
- Have you made any friends with people through social media?
- Have you ever met up with someone in person that you first met on social media?

For these interviews, I decided to take notes using my ipad, as well as recording our conversations. I received consent from both participants to record, however they were not comfortable with these recordings being posted.

## Interview Report

### Interview With Caroline

Caroline was born in South Carolina. She grew up in Georgia, and for her college education she moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts. Now that she has graduated, Caroline has moved to a new apartment in Baltimore. During these many years, Caroline utilized social media to help stay aware of what her friends were up to, enrich her hobbies, and discover new, unique activities and business near her. Currently, Caroline has found that she does not use social media nearly as much as she once used to. When questioned why, her chief reason was that her social media feeds no longer felt customized to her. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok, had not seemed to realize that she had moved out of Boston to Baltimore. As such, her primary source for finding new restaurants and exciting new adventures has run dry. She spends more time indoors, less time hanging out with people in person, an activity that she enjoyed a lot.

### Interview With Jason

Jason is a very particular person. He likes thoroughly researching new electronics before purchasing them. He spends his time reading through product reviews of skincare ointments and oils. One time, he spent two days investigating different garbage bag brands before choosing one. While Jason is much more informed about his purchases than the average person, one thing he shares with the common man is that he loves to hang out with his friends. 

More specifically, Jason loves to go to new restaurants with his friends. Currently, Jason finds new restaurants in one of two ways. About half of the restaurants he learns about through word of mouth- a recommendation from a friend or a passing mention in a relativeâ€™s story. The other half of the restaurants that Jason finds are through social media. Personalized ads on Instagram and numerous Food Vloggers provide Jason with many new, exciting restaurants and deals. For someone like Jason, the personal ads and vlog recommendations are the assurance he needs to know that going to a new restaurant with his friends is not a mistake.



## Design Opportunities
- A social media platform that shows you only posts centered around cool places to visit in person. Users would be able to filter by location, type of activity, and maybe even how many people they want to go visit this place with. Both Caroline and Jason have used social media to find places that they can visit with friends. This platform would help fuel in person connections and interactions, which is the opposite of the effect that social media tends to have.
- A social media platform that keeps a history of what someone has been upto. Users can log life events, big or small. Other users would be able to scroll through a user's past six months, filter by type of event, and quickly be able to keep up with their friends activities. A huge benefit of social media is that it allows people to seamlessly stay up to date with the people they care about. This platform would hone in on that by allowing people to only post about their activities, and allow them to catch up with a person in a quick, palatable way.
- A dating/friend finding app specifically for finding people to play games with online. Honestly, not sure if dating/friend finding apps are considered social media, but I figured it was close enough. As time has gone on, the way we meet new people has become more and more commonly online. One of the most common avenues that the younger generation meets and makes new friends is through games. By creating an app completely focused on connecting people through the medium of online games, we can embrace the best social aspects of this hobby that increasingly more people are getting into.
- A social media platform specifically for project collaboration. Users would be able to create a profile that resembles a portfolio, showcasing only their best work. User statuses can display what they are currently working on, if they are looking for team members, what contests they might currently be registered for, etc. Then, other users can message one another and share more of their work, discuss their creation methods, and sharpen their craft. As someone who recently participated in an online game jam, finding team members was extremely stressful. Not only was it difficult to filter through the many people that had signed up for the jam, but it was also hard to curate the people that had the skillset and attitude I was looking for. An app like this would be extremely useful in finding collaborators for events like game jams and hackathons.
